# SkilStak Flappy Boilerplate

Fork or just copy the `index.html` and `skilstak-flappy.js` into your
own `gh-pages` repo or main `<you>.github.io` site. Don't forget to
make your own assets.

Experiment with "hacking" the game by changing the CONFIG settings at
the beginning of the skilstak-flappy.js file, but be careful not to
break it and check for syntax errors.
